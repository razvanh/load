Since I always have a hard time coming up with ideas for gifts I thought it would be fun to create a list of cool gifts for a designer. These are probably great gifts for anyone with good taste, not just designers :)

Shopping for gifts for others can be really hard so hopefully this will make that task easier.

##[Harman Kardon CL Headphones][1]

[![harman kardon headphones](/images/gift-guide/harman-kardon-cl.jpg)][1]
I just got these headphones and I am really in love with the build quality and the sound quality. They are a big step up from the in ear apple headphones I used to use. Love the design and the build quality.

##[Lamy fountain pen][2]

I know most designers have a thing for nice pens or other type of writing instruments. Nice notebooks and pens are one of the things that I really like enjoy and you can't go wrong with a Lamy fountain pen. For the price there's nothing better. I think the quality is comparable to more expensive pens and the desingn is really unique too. You should also pick up a [refillable cartrige][3] and some [ink][4]


##[Moleskine notebooks][5]
These are great stocking stuffers. A lot of designers use and appreciate them. You can probably get great notebooks for less but Moleskine is a pretty much synonim to "designer notebook" these days :)

Books are also great gifts so here are some nice ones that you can get. If you  would like to get more ideas there is always this resource for [great design books][6].

##[Swiss Graphic Design: The Origins and Growth of an International Style, 1920-1965][7]

[![swiss graphic design](/images/gift-guide/swiss-graphic-design.jpg)][7]
An extensive incursion into Swiss style -one of the crucial styles in the history of modernism. Showcases work across a wide range of media: posters, magazines, exposition displays, brochures, ads, books and film.
