I was working on a project that uses bootstrap as a foundation and some youtube videos are played using a modal window. The problem we encountered is that the videos kept playing in the background even after the modal was dismissed. Here is a simple solution to this problem, using jQuery &#8211; clear the &#8220;src&#8221; of the iframe and add it again so you can see the video again if you want to.
