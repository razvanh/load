This is an online web store selling wedding accessories and catering to the romanian community.

The theme was built form the ground up and this was a little bit of a struggle - ZenCart is not exactly built with best practices in mind when it comes to the way the themes work. The API can be significantly improved but I think this project was a success. Once you get the hang of it everything goes smoother. 

##User engagement

I am really happy with the design decisions I made for this project. The main focus was to engage the visitors regardless of the platform they use to access the website.  I can be very confident when I say I achieved my goals. The average bounce rate for the last year is <strong>37.7%</strong> with <strong>6.79</strong> pages per session. Really happy with that.

I chose Myriad Pro as the main font as I think it goes very well with the color scheme and the clean, modern aestetic.
